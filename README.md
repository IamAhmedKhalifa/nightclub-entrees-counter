# Counter for nightclub bouncer

A fun little solo project, as apart of the Scrimba front-end development homework, to create a clicker/counter to keep track of the number of entrants.

I've decided to move it up a level by experimenting further with the JavaScript and see if I can create the 'Reset' button and totaling to work correctly (because it's not working just yet).
